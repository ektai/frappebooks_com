Let's understand the concept of accounting with the example of an imaginary
business that is just starting out.

Let’s say we’re starting a Home Interior business and we have ₹5,00,000 of
capital to start our business. Now the business has ₹5,00,000 in its bank.

Now we will need an operating place where we can work and meet clients. We rent
out a co-working space for ₹40,000 per month. This is our first expense. Our
bank balance will be ₹5,00,000 - ₹40,000 = ₹4,60,000 at this point.

We have invested some cash, we have a working place and now we have our first
sale. We earned ₹30,000 from our first customer. This is our first income. Our
bank balance at this point will be ₹4,60,000 + ₹30,000 = ₹4,90,000.

Let’s say we decided to hire a Web Agency to build a website for us, they charge
₹50,000 which will be paid after 2 months from current date. At this point we
haven’t paid them any money, but we are liable to pay them in the future. This
is a liability and will be recorded under Accounts Payable.

Let’s list these down in a table:

|                  |           |
| ---------------- | --------: |
| Owner Investment | ₹5,00,000 |
| Rent             | - ₹40,000 |
| Sales            | + ₹30,000 |
| Accounts Payable | - ₹50,000 |
| Total            | ₹4,40,000 |

Now, let's categorize these into the five types of Accounts:

**Assets**

- Bank: ₹4,90,000

**Liabilities**

- Accounts Payable: ₹50,000

**Equity**

- Owner Investment: ₹5,00,000

**Income**

- Sales: ₹30,000

**Expense**

- Rent: ₹40,000
